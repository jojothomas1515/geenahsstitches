          <h4>Thank You for Choosing Geenah’s Stitches</h4>
          <p>
            We’re thrilled that you’re interested in creating magic with us! To
            ensure we bring your vision to life seamlessly, a consultation is
            required before placing an order. This allows us to discuss your
            designs, fabric choices, and measurements in detail.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you’re unsure of the design you want, we recommend booking an
            appointment to explore ideas and create something unique together.
            However, if you already have a design in mind, simply contact us and
            provide the details so we can bring your vision to reality.
          </p>
